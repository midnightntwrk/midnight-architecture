# Flowlets

These are reusable parts of flow diagrams.  Import them into plantUML flows using the `include` directive, as in:

```
!include example.puml
```

Every flowlet `example` should be defined in three parts:

- `example.puml` : the plantUML source code for the flowlet
- `example.png` : the PNG image generated by plantUML
- `example.md` : documentation of the flowlet, including the `example.png` image for reference

See the [example](example.md) flowlet.
