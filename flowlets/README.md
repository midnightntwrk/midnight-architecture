# Flowlets

These are reusable parts of flow diagrams.  Import them into plantUML flows using the `include` directive, as in:

```
!include foo.txt
```

Every flowlet `foo` should be defined in three parts:

- `foo.puml` : the plantUML source code for the flowlet
- `foo.png` : the PNG image generated by plantUML
- `foo.md` : documentation of the flowlet, including the `foo.png` image for reference
