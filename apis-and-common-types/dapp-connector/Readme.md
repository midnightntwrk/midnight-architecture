# DApp Connector API

DApps need an API to interact with wallets, so that users can confirm their transactions and use tokens in DApp interactions. What makes this line of interaction particularly important is an asymmetry in trust and data needed to actually implement useful interactions: wallet software is usually carefully selected and receives a lot of trust from its user, while DApps may be of varying quality, their goals will vary, as well as approach to overall security and privacy (including outright malicious intents). At the same time - many honest DApps, to provide good user experience or simply basic functionality for the kind of DApp, will require access to data, that users should not share lightly in many cases, like balances of (shielded) tokens or transactions found relevant for the wallet.

The specification of the API was moved into the repository, which also hosts the type definitions, so that they can be updated together when needed: https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-dapp-connector-api/blob/main/SPECIFICATION.md
