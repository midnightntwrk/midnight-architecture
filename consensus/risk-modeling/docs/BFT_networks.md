In BFT blockchain networks, there are two critical thresholds to consider:

1. If dishonest nodes make up 1/3 or more of the total nodes, the network may "halt." These dishonest nodes can refuse to participate, preventing the remaining nodes from achieving the 2/3 supermajority needed for consensus. In this case, the network does not generate invalid transactions; it simply stops producing transactions altogether.
2. If dishonest nodes make up 2/3 or more of the total nodes, they can collude to create arbitrary transactions. This is the worst-case scenario, as the network no longer produces accurate transactions but instead generates any transactions the 2/3 dishonest supermajority desires.
