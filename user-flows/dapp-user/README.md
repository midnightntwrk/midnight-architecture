# dAPP-User Flows

*TODO: Link these flows to product use cases.*

## Calling into a dApp to update consensus state

The dApps written on Midnight respond to some user inputs by attempting to effect an on-chain state update.  These flows exercise all the main elements of the Lares programming model.  The flows have many complications and alternative sub-flows such as error cases, message reordering, session management, and handling of blockchain branching.  All of these should be documented, but often at the component level.  In this section we focus on successful end-to-end use cases, and present the flows in a series of views that add increasing detail.
