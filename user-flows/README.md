# User Flows

This folder is an aggregation of high-level, user-oriented flows in the system.  Product requirements are captured (elsewhere, where?) as *use cases* that define user interactions.  User flows are the elaboration of those use cases showing how they are implemented across the components of the computing system. 

Often the user flows expressed here can be defined as aggregations of flowlets defined for different [components](https://github.com/input-output-hk/midnight-architecture/tree/main/components).  Sometimes the workflow may run in the opposite direction: end-to-end flows first described here are then decomposed into flowlets.

## User Roles

Product use cases and system architecture should be aligned on the identities of the different users and stakeholders of the product. We identify the following user roles for Midnight.

## User-Centric Subdirectories

We find it useful to categorize flows by the user role they support.

*  [dApp-user](https://github.com/input-output-hk/midnight-architecture/tree/main/user-flows/dapp-user) for users of dApps built on Midnight
