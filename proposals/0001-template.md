# Proposal 0000: Template for Midnight Architecture Proposals
This is a template for writing new Midnight Architecture Proposals.  We want
this template to be lightweight, so that it does not impede the process of
capturing the proposals, and we to evolve this template over the time, as we
figure out the process of proposing changes to our architecture.

## Problem Statement

Describe the context and why this propsal is important.

## Proposed Changes
Describe your proposal in detail.

## Desired Result
Finally, describe what you hope to achieve and how you can evaluate that you
have achieved it.
