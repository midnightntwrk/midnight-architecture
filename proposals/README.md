# Proposals for Midnight Architecture
Here is a list of proposed changes captured in proposal documents.  We
deliberately keep the proposal format lightweight as any changes will eventually
be captured as ADRs.

## Naming and Numbering Scheme
The proposals should follow sequential numbering scheme, stating from `0001`.
File names should use `kebab-case` without any non-ASCII characters.

## List of proposals
- [0001: Template Proposal](./0001-template.md) for writing new proposals.
