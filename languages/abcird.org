#+TITLE: Abcird

Abcird (pronounced /absurd/) is a proposed programming language for compiling
programs down to zkSNARKs.

A compilation of an abcird program will involve the following tools:
- abcirdc :: a compiler written in Chez Scheme that compiles programs written in
  abcird programming language down to abcird bytecode, and
- abcird-vm :: a vm/runtime written in Rust that
  - compiles abcird bytecode to a compiled form that is understood by the
    underlying proving system, and
  - interpretes abcird bytecode to generate input vectors for the underlying
    proving system.


When working with abcird there will be following artifacts:

- abcird programs :: high-level programs written in abcird programming language,
- abcird bytecode :: abcird programs compiled by the abcird compiler,
- compiled circuits :: abcird bytecode compiled down to the form understood by the underlying proof system,
- input vectors :: computed input to the prover system.
