# Midnight Architecture

This is a repository of the Midnight software architecture documents.  While each component repository may have its own local documentation, this repo includes the specification of each component in standard terms and documents the flows, features, and deployments supported by the system.

What are *flows*, *features*, *components* and so forth?  The essential terminology of our architectural elements are defined in [definitions](definitions.md).

## Tools

Documents use text-based diagrams to enable version control of key illustrations.  The tools used include:

- [plantUML](https://plantuml.com/)
- [graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) (used by plantUML)

**Please use local installations of these tools rather than pasting IOHK confidential data into web-hosted versions.**
