# Midnight formal specification

This space is intended to formally specify formats and behaviours of Midnight.
The specification is in literate agda, providing both a prose description of
intention and reasoning, and a precise and executable definition.

The specification will initially focus on specific parts of the ledger, but is
expected to expand in scope over time.
